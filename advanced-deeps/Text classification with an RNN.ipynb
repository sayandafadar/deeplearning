It tells a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Sure it has some extremes.. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. I am not a big fan of traditional music either but I wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film.<br /><br />If someone told me to say something against this film I'd define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. I guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres..<br /><br />Anyway I could write more and more to express my thought over this but I guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend. A must see\"\n"," b\"(aka: DEMONS III)<br /><br />Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films. It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.<br /><br />An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. It drips what looks like green paint.<br /><br />Of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.<br /><br />But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids.<br /><br />The films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. There's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /><br />The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases.

A must see\"\n","Round-trip:  this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word it tells a [UNK] that here in [UNK] we live as a [UNK] in [UNK] life without [UNK] how sad it is sure it has some [UNK] but every now and then real life [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] is [UNK] [UNK] of the [UNK] we [UNK] and the whole [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] around them the film has a [UNK] [UNK] of [UNK] ways of life [UNK] and [UNK] [UNK] unlike most [UNK] films that have a certain [UNK] audience this one does not [UNK] anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and [UNK] to [UNK] your [UNK] i am not a big fan of [UNK] music either but i wouldnt like to hear anything else when it was played during the filmbr br if someone told me to say something against this film id [UNK] the [UNK] sometimes the [UNK] between scenes seemed [UNK] or somewhat cut i guess the editing had to cut it up to [UNK] the [UNK] and a bit for the [UNK] br anyway i could write more and more to [UNK] my thought over this but i guess [UNK] have to see it and [UNK] it with a friend a must see                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n","\n","Original:  b\"(aka: DEMONS III)<br /><br />Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films. It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.<br /><br />An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. It drips what looks like green paint.<br /><br />Of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.<br /><br />But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids.<br /><br />The films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. There's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /><br />The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases. This is pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />3 out of 10<br /><br />\"\n","Round-trip:  [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] br made for [UNK] tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier [UNK] films it was supposed to be simply [UNK] the [UNK] which is how director [UNK] [UNK] had released itbr br an american family [UNK] an [UNK] [UNK] for the [UNK] the woman [UNK] [UNK] has [UNK] [UNK] of herself as a little girl going down to the old [UNK] of this [UNK] an [UNK] this [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] down from the [UNK] it [UNK] and is [UNK] in [UNK] and has what looks like [UNK] or [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] down from it it [UNK] what looks like [UNK] [UNK] br of course the husband doesnt believe any of this the [UNK] just is old and [UNK] and makes strange [UNK] in the middle of the night and she should just [UNK] itbr br but then the [UNK] itself appears in what looks like some kind of [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] with what looks like a [UNK] head [UNK] to it and its [UNK] to the [UNK] of [UNK] br the films isnt really that bad and at least the dialog is [UNK] [UNK] without the ridiculous [UNK] [UNK] that [UNK] would bring theres no real gore other than some [UNK] [UNK] in a [UNK] [UNK] that really looks like the [UNK] of a modern [UNK] [UNK] the [UNK] itself just simply [UNK] away after it is run over by the [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] br br the [UNK] of the [UNK] dvd i watched was [UNK] with the picture going black for a few [UNK] about a half an hour into the film a [UNK] i hope [UNK] has since [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] a short [UNK] with [UNK] [UNK] where he [UNK] how this wasnt a sequel [UNK] with some [UNK] to other [UNK] dvd [UNK] this is pretty [UNK] [UNK] br 3 out of [UNK] br                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n","    encoder,\n","    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(\n","        input_dim=len(encoder.get_vocabulary()),\n","        output_dim=64,\n","        # Use masking to handle the variable sequence lengths\n","        mask_zero=True),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n","    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)\n","])"],"metadata":{"id":"kUQuEWszlN3A","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681841858935,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9085,"user":{"displayName":"Sayan Dafadar","userId":"01489114010454149167"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# predict on a sample text without padding.\n","\n","sample_text = ('The movie was cool.
